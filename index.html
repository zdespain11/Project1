        <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>A new generation is proudly stepping up and into their roles as owners of Bowling World. 
        Their family’s history has strongly influenced their decisions to fully take the reigns to 
        transform Bowling World to meet the desires of the modern bowler while preserving the venue 
        as a bowling center focused on providing a great affordable unique form of entertainment.
        This history includes 40 plus years of watching husband, father and father in-law, Troy Whiteaker, 
        a founding partner who’s idea to create the bowling entertainment establishment began around 1973. 
        The Million Dollar Dream became Bowling World in August of 1977 thanks to the creation of LBJ&T, Inc. 
        that included Troy and his brother JD Whiteaker plus a few other investors along the way.</p>
